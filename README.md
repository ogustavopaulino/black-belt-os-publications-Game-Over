## 📖 About the Collectanea
This set of fourteen articles forms a unified body of work: the **Black Belt OS™ Collectanea**.  
Each paper can be read independently, but together they specify, test, and defend the Black Belt OS™ as a candidate **universal structural law of human organization**.  

The sequence follows a structural logic:  
1–3 establish macro, micro, and meso levels.  
4–12 detail each process.  
13 synthesizes the full grammar (9–45–98).  
14 provides epistemological shielding.
